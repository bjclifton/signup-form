## Description

This project is a responsive signup form for an imaginary online service. It was created as part of my completion of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I practiced and improved my CSS skills.

The signup form is designed to work well on computers and larger screens. It includes various input fields for user details and utilizes CSS grid layout for a visually appealing and organized structure. The project emphasizes using CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## Features
